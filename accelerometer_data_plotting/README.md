The following code has been written using the nannou library of the rust programming language.
It is used to graphically represent the 3D accelerometer. This is done by converting each 3D vector to a 2D vector by applying appropriate transformation by converting the 3D base vectors to 2D base vectors.The data used has been taken using a bbc microbit while moving it around a particular axis.The accelerometer data and the GIF of the output of the program has been attached.
